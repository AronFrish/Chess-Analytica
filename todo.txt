- add tests
- write read me
- write docs
- filter to colors as well?
- findX functions.  An example would be findOpening() function, where it finds all the games where you did a specific opening.  You could also make other functions to find games with other specific features
- add "winner" username to each game
- fix Pypi documentation, format is messed up
- maybe make it so that when it prints out a move, it just prints out e2e4 instead of all the surrounding notation
