Welcome to Chess-Analyticas's documentation!
==============================================

chess-analytica is a chess library that allows for the simple scraping of data using the chess.com API, and subsequent 
analysis of that data.  Built on top of the python-chess library, chess-analytica allows for you to easily scrape 
all of a given player's past (or current) games, filter the games down, and then analyze them.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
